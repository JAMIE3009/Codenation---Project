<h1> Official Information</h1>
<br>
<p>My name is Jamie (legally know as James) Gibson and I have created this little Html website for a project I am doing for Codenation.</p>
<br>
<h2>A Little About Me:</h2>
<br>
<p>I consider myself to be an enthusiastic, considerate and passionate person. I am a very sporty person that has an unwavering love for football, I used to play semi-pro for Enfield FC when I was (much) younger and nowadays I just play for my local Men’s team Broomfield FC.  I also play Tennis for my local club Brackendale TC and have a love for sociable events such as going out with my friends or even just relaxing together and playing video games.   
<br>
<br>
This brings me nicely to one of my biggest and longest standing passions, that being video games! This is why I am so passionate about learning to code. I have always loved technology and the intrigue this course has stirred up within me is something I plan to peruse with my signature enthusiasm I mentioned earlier. The process’s of programming anything has been so interesting to me, and couple that with the fact that I myself and a few others created an actual fully functioning text based game has really been amazing. I have plans to carry on my learning process best I can independently and expect to be having many a late night at my computer playing with lines of code and seeing what kind of games and such I can create.</p>
