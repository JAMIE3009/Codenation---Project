    <h2>1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
    <br>
    <p>The purposes of IT in modern business is such a broad question that I think it may be best to speak on the functions IT can play within a business, and, from that we can glean the purposes ‘s IT runs. Firstly, one could argue that, IT plays the most important role in any business, in that it is tied to the communication, and I doubt many could argue the purpose and importance of communication.  Code Nation itself as a business has utilised many aspects of communication via the platform of IT, using apps such as ZOOM and Stack as a means to run interactive lessons and web-based sharing/video lessons. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>1.2 -  Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills? </h2>
    <br>
    <p>This brings me nicely onto methods; skills and resources needed to complete digital projects, whilst not all listed are of intrinsic importance, no one would argue the importance of VS code (Visual Studio).  Visual code studio provides the foundations for coding any programme and seeing as it is a free download that really makes it a very useful application. Furthermore, applications such as; Trello, Repl, Microsoft Office and any form of video conference call such as; ZOOM, Google Hang Outs, Skype and Whatsapp.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>1.3 -  Plan and carry out tasks using IT</h2>
    <br>
    <p>In regards to planning an IT project such as making a website, please follow my link to my <a href=https://trello.com/b/03Rq0tgI/final-project>Trello</a> board.  Trello provides a visual aid in which one can arrange tasks, prioritise the importance of said tasks and organise them into convenient sub-categories such as; ‘to do, doing and done’. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>1.4 -  Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Risks associated with digital projects can be ten-fold, I shall endeavour to limit these risks to 5;
    <br> 
    1. Misalignment with business processes – How and why are you doing this idea? How is it being advertised? Have you and your team/company all agreed on the end products vision? It is all well and good having the best marketting team and or idea, but, you must not overlook the resulting impacts on the company’s business processes, the initiative is likely to fail if you do this. 2. A Lack of cross- functional expertise – One of the biggest misconceptions in the digital process is the need for ‘techy people’ only on the project, this could not be further away from the truth and the team would massively benefit from a wide variety of expertise. 3. Limited digital strategy – This one is more centred towards the strategy of the project, and how it is important to define how success would look for the project and how that contributes to the companies and or individuals business strategy. 4. Fixed plans - to the point they do not account for change. This one kind of writes itself, but put simply, one must be flexible and open to change. Technology is an ever changing landscape, you must be able to adapt for your projects’ success. 5. Over ambition - This one may sound a little strange, but when you consider the endless possibilities that tech provides and then account in the realistic elements of business craft / human ability , it is important to manage expectations and have a viable product as the starting point, opposed to attempting to reach AAA standards when they might not be attainable as a starting point</p>
    <br>
    <h2>1.5 - Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software –how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>How to choose the right software is potentially a very straightforward process. Define what it is you are trying to achieve, find applications appropriate for the task and from this process consider these 5 things; 
        1.	Look at the “Big Picture” and Create a Simple Plan. Review your current processes, and identify areas for potential improvement. 
        2.	Prioritize Your Needs. There is no perfect one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to software. 
        3.	Create a Software Vendor Short List.
        4.	Validate Your Short List. 
        5.	Make the Decision.</p>
    <h2> 1.6 -  Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I have chosen Trello for my planning process, I came to this decision as I have prior experience with the application so thus feel confident in its’ capacity and its’ functionality. Furthermore, I have chosen VS code for the skeleton of the code for my project as similarly I have prior experience with the application and I trust its’ functionality and believe it to be the best software I have at my disposal to complete this project. I have also utilised Microsoft Office (word) for the bulk of the ‘substance’ as I have much experience with the application and I believe it to be the best fit for what I am trying to achieve in regards to the text based side of the project.</p>

   <h2>1.7 -  Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a legal framework that sets guidelines for the collection and processing of personal information from individuals who live in the European Union (EU).

        •	 Lawfulness, fairness and transparency.
        •	Purpose limitation.
        •	Data minimisation.
        •	Accuracy.
        •	Storage limitation.
        •	Integrity and confidentiality (security)
        •	Accountability.

    <br>
    <br>
    The Internet has dramatically changed the way we communicate and how we handle everyday tasks. We share documents, we pay bills and we purchase goods by entering our personal details all online and without a second thought. Have you ever stopped to wonder how much personal data you have shared online?
    Or what happens to that information? This new data protection regulation puts the consumer in the driver’s seat, and the task of complying with this regulation falls upon businesses and organizations. Otherwise, you're failing to comply, and as a result you can expect to face a hefty fine. GDPR’s impact is ten-fold on digital projects, providing a frame-work that must be followed strictly.</p>
