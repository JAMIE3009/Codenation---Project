    <h2> 3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms ofproductivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?</h2>
    <br>
    <p> There are so many ways I believe I could have been more efficient in the making of this website. Moreover, even just the most menial of things spring to mind, such as, copying and pasting various aspects of the code (seeing as it was very repetitive) would have probably saved me so much time. Additionally, I do believe (I will have said this a lot I believe) that if I had more time I could have done so much more with the website, really planned and really delivered an interactive experience. If I had a team in which to complete this project with then there would have been a really good opportunity to delegate / share out the written content in such a way that it could have freed someone up to be far more creative with the site than I have been able to, also, just by virtue of greater numbers I feel that would have created a much more collaborative and ideas heavy type environment, opposed to just me going with my ideas every-time.I do feel it worth mentioning off the bat that if I had owned a Laptop that was not over 10 years old that would of definitely contributed to greater productivity and efficiency. Furthermore, I do believe there were many ways I could have been more efficient in making my website, I think it would have been better to get the bare bones of the sites operational before writing out all the various responses to questions, although one could argue I did it the most efficient way. I think the delegation of tasks would have had this project much easier to achieve. Additionally, a team could have had a much bigger pool of knowledge to draw from, by virtue of having more than one person on the project, “two heads are always better than one” as the saying goes</p>
    <br>
    <h2>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency</h2>
    <br>
    <p> I have literally just said this, but, I can’t over/understate how important it is to just do the most menial of things, such as, copying and pasting various aspects of the code (seeing as it was very repetitive) would have probably saved me so much time. Additionally, I do believe (I will have said this a lot I believe) that if I had more time I could have done so much more with the website, really planned and really delivered an interactive experience. I think in terms of my productivity I could of defiantly of benefitted from taking more breaks and scheduling my time as to optimise my performance.perhaps arguably most efficient way to improve efficiency is to set reasonable goals for yourself within the scope of the project, breaking down seemingly longer tasks into smaller ones or to even go as far to say setting small goals continuously as to build momentum.  Moreover, PUT YOUR PHONE DOWN! . I feel this one is rather self-explanatory, but such is life, I will develop my point. In today’s modern globalised world you are merely a click away from ultimate distraction, with the advent of social media, 24-hour news and mobile gaming, one can only try their best, but it is important I would say to put yourself in the best position possible when it comes to these distractions, for example, sounds menial but turn your phone off?  The endless world of procrastination is merely one click away, so it is important as I say to get yourself into a space in which distractions are as limited as possible.</p>

    <h2> 3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>I do get the sense I may be actually repeating myself rather a lot now, so apologies if that has been the case, but again I would defiantly work with a team next time, I much prefer collaborative efforts opposed to individual. Moreover, I should have organised my time better, I could of utilised Trello much more I feel as an example.  I would have spent more time researching fun and interactive ways to make the information that laden’s my website seem much less like a learning experience a kin to reading a book and, more like an experience tailored towards fun.I would most definitely Team up for this project if it were an option, I feel like the delegation of tasks, coupled with collaborative thinking process and work ethic would have made this task perfect for a team of 2 (maybe 3 ). I feel Slack would have been a great tool in which to organise the material and get the team together (virtually via zoom or whatever video app you prefer). I also think Slack represents the perfect community in which to work on projects, the chat rooms are easily accessible, functions are easy to understand and use and perhaps most important it works without any major incident (been using it over 3 weeks and never had any issues with it).</p>

    <h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Visual Studio is the foundation of this website and it is just as well it is to, as, without the problem solution terminal that is present within the programming I doubt I would have a functioning website. In regards to actual testing of digital solutions, I do believe there is no greater way to than ‘play testing’.  As suggested ‘play testing’ is the action in which you start to make the various operations within your programme work, finding errors and of course fixing them (or even just changing tact completely). Test processes should be well planned, defined, and documented. Good documentation is the tool that builds efficient communication within the software team.  So, effective planning entails the creation of the quality and test plans for a project. A quality management plan is a document that defines an acceptable level of product quality and describes how the project will achieve this level. It isn’t a mandatory document, but it will help you schedule all the tasks needed to make sure that the project <a href="https://www.altexsoft.com/blog/engineering/8-ways-to-improve-software-testing-through-planning-work-environment-automated-testing-and-reporting">REF</a></p>
