    <h2> 2.1 - Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making
        your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code,
        Trello</h2>
    <br>
    <p> I regards to the tools I have used, I must say I am more than happy with VS code, I find it to be very useable and functional, if I were to review my website I would definitely use VS code again. However, in regards to Trello, the other application I used, I am not sure I would bother with it again, I found it to be a bit useless for my style of working, I think it is useful but just not a good match up for me personally. I found Trello to be a bit of task within itself, a part of me just does not see the point in having tasks mapped out in such a way, almost felt like planning just for planning sake (just my opinion). However, one could not aruge the functional and sensible layout that Trello provides in particular for group projects</p>
    <br>
    <h2> 2.2 - Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code,
        Trello</h2>
    <p>I believe the tools I used to be more than appropriate, particularly VS code. VS code gave me the platform to clearly define my code and implement it without many errors due to the intuitive algorithm VS runs whilst you are working through your code.  However, whilst I understand the applications Trello can be utilised for, I really did not feel like it contributed to my project very much, I would probably go to the lengths of saying it was rather time consuming, and, I myself am much more inclined to just start working and plan around my progress, opposed to having planned and mapped out a nice looking Trello board.</p>
    <br>
    <h2> 2.3 - Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with
     your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests
    of openness. What would you change?</h2>
    <p>Review of my website, I feel my objective was to have a fully optimised website that was fully functional, no ‘bells and whistles’, and as such I believe my goal was achieved. I would say I am happy with the website as I have never created one before, so that’s a nice feeling (to actually have created something that works) and due to the nostalgia one gets from such a feeling I would be remised to comment on weaknesses. However, the project requires such. Moreover, I do believe that if I had more time to put together the website I could of incorporated a lot more interactive elements of the website, more links to useful information, perhaps even a link to my CV (I am trying to get a job, I think this wouldn’t be bad exposure for me and a good chance to showcase my abilities) and, maybe even some interactive learning games that could be situated on the site.</p>
    <br>
    <h2> 2.4 - Describe further improvements you can make to your project</h2>
    <br>
    <p>There are many improvements I could make to the website I have created, firstly; I would like to think that if I had more time to put together the website that it would look more aesthetically pleasing. Secondly, I would have really liked to have been able to programme in some interactive games around the topics I have been discussing, whether they would have just been purely for fun or learning purposes would have been a whole new decision to consider to. Thirdly, and lastly, I think it would have been really interesting to see if I could of made alot of the content on the site (the answers) interactive, like say how you can make certain animations via slides on powerpoint presenatations, I think that would have been pretty interesting and informative</p>
    <br>   
    <h2>2.5 - Review otucomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose</h2>  
    <br>
    <p>I set out with the goal of creating a functional website that had a navigation bar that was fully operational and of course to answer the various questions I was assigned within the confines of the website. I have gone through the website on a number of occasions to ensure it actually works, and that links are correct, also not forgetting to check for punctuation/ spelling (big apologies if anything is spelt wrong).</p>
