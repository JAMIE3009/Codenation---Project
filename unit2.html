    <h2> 1.1 - Describing the content and layout for each page</h2>
    <br>
    <p> Please see below the exact specs that are in use on my website currently. I encorporated a simple and professional look (least I think so) as to showcase how simple and professional trumps more flashy sites. In case you are not aware this is CSS coding that compliments / accompanies my website.
    <br>
        background-image: url("sea.jpg");
        -webkit-background-size: cover; 
        -moz-background-size: cover; 
        -o-background-size: cover; 
        background-size: cover;
    <br>
    <br>
    P stands for paragraph; color whitesmoke, font-size 25, padding 50, margin 70, border 7, border colour (does not let you spell correctly in CSS) black, boarder style solid, text-align centre and background colour rbg ( 0, 0, 0, 0.4)

    <p> Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites
        Introduction 
        Copyright law originated in the United Kingdom from a concept of common law; the Statute of Anne 1709. It became statutory with the passing of the Copyright Act 1911. The current act is the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. <a href="https://copyrightservice.co.uk/copyright/p01_uk_copyright_law">CommonLaw</a>
    <br>
        The law gives the creators of literary, dramatic, musical, artistic works, sound recordings, broadcasts, films and typographical arrangement of published editions, rights to control the ways in which their material may be used. This now as you could guess affects the Internet and the very free connected space we have all come to expect and enjoy. Copyright and other intellectual property laws affect websites because it may restrict what you are able to publish. The best way to get around this is first, get permission from the original author, second, if you want to publish information on your site from another site, link to it and perhaps get permission to publish an excerpt from the original site.</p>
    <br> 
    <h2> 1.6 - Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them</h2>
    <br>
    <p>First and foremost it is important to consider making your website as accessible as possible as a starting point, and it is common place (and so it should be) for websites to have disability friendly user- interfaces, audio prompts, visual prompts and or even in some cases audio commands within the website. However, I strongly believe that technology whilst obviously making great strides within making everyday life more accessible for the disabled should be doing more, I think there needs to be greater emphasis on tech that can read and or write for people tech a kin to the call textext5010 (the machine Stephen Hawking uses) and greater work needs to be done for the blind community in regards to getting them access laptops and PCs they can use without it costing them 1000s of pounds.  Whilst these types of programmes do exist, in my experience I have found them to be vastly underfunded and or vastly over priced. I think access is a basic human right, and I am pretty sure the Geneva Convention actually states that disabled people have the same rights to the access in regard to the physical and technological world we live in.</p>

    <h2> 1.7 - Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
JPEG
Joint Photographics Expert Group - otherwise known as a JPEG or JPG are the most popular choice when saving photographs as they are capable of containing over 16 million different colours. They are also a good choice for saving images with complex colour and shading. JPEGs are probably the best file format for photographs on the web as the level of flexible compression when saving means they are capable of shrinking to a smaller file size and, therefore, they won’t have a negative effect on pagespeed. For example, a compressed 80KB image won’t take as long to load as a 8MB image as its smaller size means it requires less resources to load.
<br>
<br>
However, when it comes to graphics and text, JPEGS are not the best option as they use lossy compression, meaning they lose a lot of information when saved, making text or lines blurry in the process. Therefore, PNGs or GIFs would be the better choice. 
<br>
<br>
GIFs tend to be much smaller file sizes compared to other formats and aren’t capable of containing millions of colours. Just like PNGs, GIFs also support transparency, which would make them suitable for small graphics and logos, and due to their small file size, this format is great for placing lots of small graphics such as icons and buttons on the same page.
As GIFs can hold both text and transparent backgrounds, they are perfect for creating banners that intend to hold text on top of colours or images. However, as GIFs can’t handle as many colours as a JPEG or PNG, they aren’t suitable for photographs and images with lots of colour and shading. The most interesting thing about GIFs is that they can be animated, meaning you can make moving images for your website such as an animated logo because they are raster based. Although the quality wouldn’t be amazing, you can also cut film clips and save them as a GIF to upload to your website.

SVG
SVGs are vector based formats, meaning they aren’t built using pixels like the other three formats we’ve looked at, instead they’re built using mathematical formulas. As SVGs are based on vectors, they aren’t the best choice when saving photographs, however, they are a good choice for drawings and line art.
With SVGs, you can create full resolution images that will look good on any screen size, zoom level or resolution, which makes these great for graphics that can be viewed on all devices such as desktop, tablets and mobile phones. SVGs do not require any HTML requests and will, therefore, improve page speed. This also means that SVGs are great for creating logos that will be used on different screen sizes and resolutions.
Another thing to remember about SVGs is that they can be animated too; they’re very similar to GIFs, except for the fact that they are vector based, not raster. <a href="https://www.ballyhoo.co.uk/What-are-the-Best-File-Formats-for-Your-Websites-Images.html#:~:text=As%20there%20are%20many%20different,a%20lossy%20or%20lossless%20compression.">PressMe</a></p>
